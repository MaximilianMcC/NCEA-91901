## üßì Stakeholder questions
Create a list of questions that you can give to the stakeholder/stakeholders. These questions should include what the product should do, who will be using it, how it should be used, etc. The questions can be more business sided, or more focused on the task that the product accomplishes.

## üöö Brief and Specifications
The brief and specifications help you understand the task.


**Brief** should include information about the client. This is can include information such as their brand information and what they do. There should also be information about the products target audience. The most important part of this is an explanation about what should be done, and why it should be done.

**Specifications** should define the requirements for the outcome. This is a list of tasks that need to be completed to finish the project. This list can include stuff such as the appearance, what the product dose, etc. This should all be measurable so that progress updates can be shared with the Stakeholders.

## ü§¢ Gut test
The gut test is used to get the clients first feelings about a particular design. The client is shown a large collection of different images and then they point out stuff that they like about the design, and stuff that they dislike about said design. With this information, it makes it easy to get an idea about how the client would like the final product to look/function. For best results, the client should rate the design on a scale from 1-10, with 1 being really bad, and 10 being really good.

## ü§îüí≠ Relevant Implications
Relevant implications is focusing on the tasks that are required to complete the project. This includes social, legal, privacy stuff as well as accessibility, usability, functionality, and aesthetics. It also is focused on future proofing the design, and focusing on the user. Justifying how the design can be further developed in the future is important.

## ü§¢ü§Æ User Experience
UX, or user experience, focuses on the way the client interacts with the application/website. This can be stuff like the location of form elements, or the feel of it. To make a good UX design, lots of research must be done. This research can help design a fluent design that is simple, and easy to use for clients/users. There are many different methods to do this.

**User Survey / User Research** is when you conduct a study to see what the users want, and how a user-friendly UX can be develop. Questions about the application can be made here. For example, what sort of layout are you looking for. It is mostly related to asking the users what they need. Questions related to the product should be asked. For example, if you were making a sleep tracker app, you would ask questions such as *"How many hours of sleep do you get per night?"*

**Providing user feedback** is important as it helps maintain a connection between you, and the client to work together to have one idea.

**Competitive analysis** is the process of comparing one product, and it's list of features against another.
